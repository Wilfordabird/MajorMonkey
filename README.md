# MajorMonkey

Summary: The purpose of our project is to help provide students with options for their undergraduate majors.

This project will help students outline which majors they are on the closest track to completing so they can plan accordingly.

Input: List of courses taken at Yale.
Will error check to ensure courses are valid and in DB course history
